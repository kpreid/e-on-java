# XXX documentation obsolete. Should be rewritten to de-emphasize versions
# per se, and instead mostly talk groups of switch settings.

# Settings of syntactic properties for a particular form of E. The
# expansion of E to Kernel-E depends upon these switches. Nothing else
# should.

# The settings of these switches that support a particular version of
# E are given by first reading the resource file
# 'syntax-props-default.txt', and then reading the shadowing
# definitions in 'syntax-props-<version>.txt', where the <version>
# string of is just the numeric part of the version with the parts
# separated by hyphens. For example, the <version> string "0-8-25"
# would represent the canonical version of the 0.8.25* sequence, which
# happens to be "0.8.25n". This means that the description of a
# particular version isn't settled until the minor letter settles. As
# of this writing, 0.8.25n is the earliest version of the language to
# be described by these mechanisms.

# These files are in the classpath and accessible by E expressions
# like
#
#     <resource:org/erights/e/elang/syntax/syntax-props-<version>.txt>
#
# where the appropriate text is substituted for <version>.
#
# An individual E compilation unit can declare itself to be written in
# a particular version of E by saying, for example:
#
#     pragma.syntax("0-8-25")
#
# This has exactly the effect of loading the definitions corresponding
# that version of E, in order to effect the parsing and expansion of
# the remainder of this compilation unit. (XXX We should insist that
# this directive occur as a top-level expression, to avoid ambiguity
# as to when it starts to apply. We don't enforce this yet, but you
# should follow this practice.) This directive does *not* cause any
# further attempts to be compatible with that version beyond the
# changes caused by these switch settings.

# Over time, the switches used to describe each version may change in
# order to, as closely as possible, continue to support that old
# version of the language in the context of the new language
# implementation. The first priority is to ensure that, *if a program
# is accepted*, then its meaning is adequately preserved. When the old
# meaning of old constructs is no longer supported, the settings of
# these switches should disallow those constructs, causing programs
# using these constructs to be statically rejected.

# As the language changes, the default settings are likely to get more
# restrictive over time, so that a program which does not declare its
# version is likely to be restricted to that subset of the language
# which means the same thing in all the versions of the language since
# 0.8.25n.


# To ease the transition to the new restricted syntax, you can set
# some of the switches below to 'warn' or 'true'.

# This syntax switch mechanism was originally added to allow
# experimentation. All these features were added for reasons that
# seemed good at the time. If you feel a particular feature's revival
# (making it again part of official E) is a good idea, please try it
# out and if you still think it would be a good idea, please speak up
# and explain why.


# If e.enable.anon-lambda is set to 'true', E accepts the
# " 'fn' params... '{' eExpr '}' lambda shorthand. To turn a program
# using this feature into a proper
# modern E program, this form should be prefixed by 'def' and the
# method body should be explicitly declared with 'method' rather than
# 'to', since an anon-lambda doesn't bind '__return'.

e.enable.anon-lambda=true


# Accept the 'eExpr::bar' shorthand as a representation of the . 'eExpr::bar'
# as an expression expands to 'eExpr.__getPropertySlot("bar").getValue()'. If
# the Miranda __getPropertySlot/1 is not overridden, this will be equivalent to
# 'eExpr.getBar()'. 'eExpr1::bar := eExpr2' expands (approximately) to
# 'eExpr.__getPropertySlot("bar").setValue(eExpr2)', which, when using the
# Miranda behavior, will be equivalent to 'eExpr1.setBar(eExpr2)'. Finally,
# 'eExpr::&bar' expands to 'eExpr.__getPropertySlot("bar")'. The Miranda
# behavior of this synthesizes a Slot whose getValue/0, setValue/1 accesses
# eExpr's getBar/0, setBar/1.
#
# We say "(approximately)" above, since the value of the assignment expression
# will be the value expr2 evaluates to.

e.enable.dot-props=allow


# Accept the experimental 'meta.getState()' expression, which reifies
# the current lexical environment into a ConstMap. The semantics of
# this construct only has the scope within an object include those
# variables defined outside the object that are used freely within the
# object -- the instance variables. This is currently a kernel
# construct, but will likely get redefined as syntactic shorthand that
# expands to a collection-definition expression.
#
# Also controls other experimental meta constructs in the same
# category, which, until 0.8.25e, included 'meta.context()'.
# ('meta.context()' is now an official part of the language, since it is used
# by the expansion of 'interface'.

e.enable.meta-scope=true


# Accept the " 'def' name.verb(params...) {...}" definition
# shorthand. Instead, the explicit object definition syntax should be
# used, where this method is an explicit method.

e.enable.one-method-object=allow


# Accept the experimental
# " 'def' name 'match' pattern '{' eExpr '}' "
# kernel construct. This is not a shorthand, so if you need it
# there's nothing to do instead.

e.enable.plumbing=true


# Once upon a time, there was general agreement that a tab character
# in a plain text file took you to the next tab stop, which was every
# 8 characters. The Microsoft blight has not only screwed up the
# newline conventions and the filepath separator conventions (of which
# the Mac is equally guilty), but also screwed up the meaning of the
# tab key. The best path to sanity is to simply avoid the presence of
# tab characters in text files, with the one unfortunate exception of
# "Makefile"s and "*.mk" files.
#
# Unfortunately, because so many text editors put tabs into files in a
# way that's hard to turn off, E must, by default, accept tabs as a
# valid whitespace character. However, to help you prevent yourself
# from including tabs, we provide the "notabs" switch, which defaults
# to "false". If you set it to true, the tab character will not be
# considered valid whitespace.

e.enable.notabs=allow


# Enables syntax such as 'require (cond) else {str}' to be accepted
# and be equivalent of
# <pre>    require.else__control(fn{[[cond],fn{str}]}).run__control()</pre>

e.enable.lambda-args=allow


# Enable the deprecated 'delegate' syntax, which has been superceded by
# 'extends'.

e.enable.delegate-clause=allow


################ New as of 0.8.20 #######################


# Allows the expression syntax '[..., => foo, ...]' as shorthand for
# '[..., "foo" => foo, ...]'

e.enable.exporter=true


# Allows the pattern syntax '[..., => foo, ...]' as shorthand for
# '[..., "foo" => foo, ...]'

e.enable.importer=true


# In the context of a map-pattern, whether the explicit one or the one
# using the above importer syntax, e.enable.pattern-default enables a
# value-pattern position to also include an optional default value, so
# that
# <pre>    map =~ [..., "foo" => foo := expr, ...]</pre>
# or
# <pre>    map =~ [..., => foo := expr, ...]</pre>
# will succeed even if <tt>map</tt> contains no mapping for
# <tt>"foo"</tt>, in which case <tt>foo</tt> will be bound to the
# value of the expr.
#
# Note: the above proposed syntax sucks, but the semantics seems
# good. What would be a better syntax?

e.enable.pattern-default=true


# In reaction to the bug "<a href=
# "http://bugs.sieve.net/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=125519&group_id=16380"
# >need type guard on data from renderer</a>", these three switches
# exist so an individual module may elect to enable them for itself,
# forcing itself to be more explicit. Such per-module enabling can be
# done with, for example, a
# <tt>pragma.enable("explicit-final-guard")<tt>.
# <p>
# When off ('false' or 'allow'), the corresponding guard declarations
# may be ommitted, in which case a default guard is provided. When on
# ('true'), those guard declarations must always be explicitly
# provided. The official E language allows all these kinds of guards
# to be ommitted, and therefore these switches must not be 'true' by
# default.
# <p>
# Note that the definition of an object name in an object definition
# expression does not allow a guard, so none of these switches will
# cause one to be required there.
# <p>
# As with all pragmas, these pragma swicthes are not part of the
# official E language. In fact, we expect to retire these swicthes
# and migrate the ability to ask for this extra check into an advisory
# static checker.
#
# e.enable.explicit-slot-guard added as of 0.8.23g

e.enable.explicit-final-guard=allow
e.enable.explicit-var-guard=allow
e.enable.explicit-slot-guard=allow
e.enable.explicit-result-guard=true

# Allows the new "accumulator" syntax that has most of the advantages
# of list comprehension (from Haskell and Python), but is more
# E-like. For example, with this property enabled, one can write:
# <pre>
#     accum [] for i in 1..5 { + i**2 }
# </pre>
# to accumulate the list [ 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 ]. This expands into
# <pre>
# {
#     var accum_n := []
#     for i in 1..5 {
#         accum_n += { i**2 }
#     }
#     accum_n
# }
# </pre>
# Note that this is more flexible but more verbose than a list
# comprehension, and less flexible and comparably verbose to a
# Smalltalk injection.

e.enable.accumulator=allow


# Turns on the unary prefix '*' operator.
# <pre>
#     *x</pre>
# expands to<pre>
#     x.getValue()</pre>
# so, by the normal assignment rules,<pre>
#     *x := y</pre>
# expands approximately to<pre>
#     x.setValue(y)</pre>
# except that the expansion also arranges for the value of the
# expression to be the value of y.

e.enable.unary-star=allow


################ New as of 0.8.23g #######################

# e.enable.explicit-slot-guard added as of 0.8.23g, but it appears
# above because it's part of a group.

# Has two related effects. It makes a left out method result guard
# default to the equivalent of :any (internally represented with a
# null), and it changes the expansion of 'to' methods into primitive
# methods so that an explicit return is required to return a non-null
# value.
# <pre>
# to foo() { ... } ===> method foo() :void { escape __return { ... } }</pre>
# to <pre>
# to foo() { ... } ===> method foo() { escape __return { ...; null } }</pre>

e.enable.easy-return=allow

################ New as of 0.8.24c #######################

# Allows the 'escape' expression, and the loop expressions which build
# on it -- 'while', 'for' -- to be optionally followed by an
# escape-handler. As of the 0.8.24c release, the optional
# escape-handler is written with the same syntax as the catch-clause
# of a try-catch block: 'catch' pattern '{' expression '}'.
#
# An escape expression with an escape-handler is therefore written as<pre>
#     escape ejector-pattern {
#         body-expression
#     } catch handler-pattern {
#         handler-expression
#     }
# </pre>
# If such an escape expression, if the ejector is invoked during the
# execution of body-expression, body-expression is terminated, the
# handler-pattern is matched against the argument to the ejector, and
# the handler-expression is evaluated in the resulting scope.
#
# In a while-loop or for-loop with a escape-handler, if the break
# ejector is called, the loop is exited and the argument to break is
# passed to the handler.

e.enable.escape-handler=true

################ New as of 0.8.25h #######################

# Allows the syntax (ignoring precedence)
# <pre>    expr ::= specimen-expr ':' guard-expr</pre>
# which expands to

#     Guard.coerce(guard-expr, null).coerce(specimen-expr, null)
# </pre>

e.enable.cast=true


################ New as of 0.8.25h #######################

# Allows the use of unary prefix '^' as a synonym for 'return'.

e.enable.smalltalk-return=warn

################ New as of 0.8.25h #######################

# Allows a literal string anywhere an identifier would be accepted as a verb

e.enable.verb-string=true

################ New as of 0.8.30b #######################

# Allows 'foo.bar' to expand to
# '__makeVerbFacet.curryCall(foo, "bar")', so that '(foo.bar)(x,y)' can
# have the same effect as 'foo.bar(x,y)'.
#
# Likewise, allows 'foo <- bar' to expand to
# '__makeVerbFacet.currySend(foo, "bar")', so that '(foo <- bar)(x,y)' can
# have the same effect as 'foo <- bar(x,y)'.
#
# The result should be a function which responds to "run" with any number
# of arguments by calling (or sending) the corresponding "bar" method on the
# "foo" object. Inspired by the <a href="http://www.waterken.com"
# >web-calculus</a>, this is a cheap notation for forming a bar-only
# unforseen-facet (a filtering forwarder, sort-of) on the "foo" object.

e.enable.verb-curry=allow

################ New as of 0.8.32f #######################

# Enables various short forms of the when-catch construct, as discussed in the
# thread starting at
# http://www.eros-os.org/pipermail/e-lang/2004-December/010242.html

e.enable.easy-when=true

# Enables '->'s to be chained, forming what this thread refers to as an
# "event sequence". (Dean points out that "when sequence" is less ambiguous,
# since E has many event sequences.)

e.enable.when-sequence=allow

################ New as of 0.8.33o #######################

# Allows a literal string anywhere an identifier would be accepted as a noun

e.enable.noun-string=allow

################ New as of 0.8.34p #######################

# Used to allow the syntax

################ Discontinued Switches ####################


# The e.enable.bind switch has been retired, since 'bind' is now
# considered an official part of the language.

# The e.enable.meta-object switch has been retired, since 'meta(name)'
# is no longer supported, even as an experimetal feature.

# The e.enable.sub-object switch has been retired, since the 'extends'
# syntax is now considered an official part of the language.

# The e.enable.define switch has been retired, since we are now
# committed to spelling this keyword only as 'def'.

# The e.enable.no-paren-call switch has been retired, since no-parens
# following a dot are now an object-property access, and no-dot-calls
# are now deprecated.

# The e.enable.no-paren-method switch has been retired, since it makes
# little sense without the availability of e.enable.no-paren-call.

# in 0.8.18 and 0.8.19, the e.enable.explicit-*-guard switches were
# instead named e.enable.implicit-*-guard, and had the opposite
# sense. This was switched to preserve the property that the official
# language as of any release is defined by the behavior when all
# e.enable.* switches are off.

#### Discontinued as of 0.8.20 ####

# e.enable.typedef, as the interface shorthand for creating a
# rubber-stamping auditor/guard is now an official part of the
# language/

# e.enable.auditors, as the 'implements' syntax for requiring auditor
# approval is now an official part of E and Kernel-E. (thanks Ping!)

# e.enable.new-constructor is now retired. Its documentation used to
# say:
#
# Constructors in E are now mapped to the 'run' method name. They
# used to be mapped to the 'new' method name instead. When this flag
# is turned on, constructors are mapped to the 'new' method name in
# addition to the 'run' mapping. This applies in two contexts:
# 1) To the expansion of the E language 'class' expression. This is
# done on a per-emaker basis controllable by the usual
# 'pragma enable(..)' and 'pragma disable(..)', and is only relevent
# in contexts where e.enable.class-expr is also true.
# 2) To the binding of a Java class constructor to an E method name.
# This done only on a per-JVM basis. Per-vat or per-emaker settings
# of these flags have no further effect.

#### Discontinued as of 0.8.23j ####

# Enable the deprecated 'class' syntax, which has been superceded by
# 'extends'.
#
# e.enable.class-expr=allow

#### Discontinued as of 0.8.26d ####

# e.enable.no-dot-call is now retired. Rather than the old
# 'bob foo(carol)', one must now write 'bob.foo(carol)'.

# e.enable.when-clauses is now retired. This alternate when-catch
# syntax was never used and would have been a bad idea.

#### Discontinued as of 0.8.30c ####

# e.enable.synthetic-slot=allow used to enable a particular expansion of
# unary prefix '&' applied to a non-noun lValue expression.

# e.enable.access-slot=allow was to allow another expansion of
# unary prefix '&' applied to a non-noun lValue expression.

#### Discontinued as of 0.8.36e ####

# Enables an argument list to end with a sequence of map associations
# without needing to surround them with square brackets. Likewise, it
# enables a parameter list to end with a sequence of map association
# patterns. This makes name-based parameters seem first class.

# e.enable.map-tail=true

#### Discontinued as of 0.8.36s ####

# Allows the syntax "given" rValueExpr "=~" pattern
# e.enable.given=allow

# Allows the syntax "given" "(" rValueExpr "," optEjectorExpr ")" "=~" pattern
# e.enable.trinary-given=allow

# Allows the syntax rValueExpr "into" pattern
# e.enable.into=allow

# Allows the syntax rValueExpr "into" "^" "(" optEjectorExpr ")" pattern
# e.enable.trinary-into=allow

#### Discontinued as of 0.8.37a ####

# Allows the use of a literal string as an object-expr's qualified or
# fully-qualified name.
