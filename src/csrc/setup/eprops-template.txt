# If you are looking at eprops-template.txt, then you are looking at a
# template to be used to construct eprops.txt. In this case, for
# several property definitions, you should instead see text of the
# form, for example,
#
#     e.version=$<<e.version>>
#
# but with curly brackets instead of angle brackets.
#
# In the comment preceding that line, you should see an example of a
# possible value of this property, such as "0.8.9". Were this
# property to have this value in the eprops.txt file, it would appear
# as
#
#     e.version=0.8.9
#
# The eprops.txt file is written in a restricted form of Java's
# Properties file save/load syntax. If you are looking at an
# eprops.txt file, all property definitions should already have the
# above form. You may create an eprops.txt file manually by copying
# the eprops-template.txt file and replacing the
# dollar-double-curly-bracket form with the Java property definition.
#
# NEW (as of 0.8.14b): To ease manual installation, some of the
# entries in the eprops-template.txt file list the default value as
# their value rather than a dollar-double-curly form. After copying
# eprops-template.txt to eprops.txt, you don't need to edit these, but
# you may.
#
# Notice that there are no quotes around the value. This is correct
# even if the property value contains spaces, since the Java property
# syntax reads all text from the "=" till the end of the line.
#
# When a property value is a file or directory path name, it should be
# absolute and use forward slashes ("/"), regardless of the local
# platform's convention. If it's a non-top-level directory, a
# terminal slash is optional. Note: On MSWindows, you must specify
# drives the MSWindows/Java way ("c:...") rather than the Cygwin way
# ("//c/...").
#
# When a property value is a pathlist (a list of paths, sometimes also
# confusingly refered to as a "path", as in the PATH or CLASSPATH
# variables), then the entries should be separated by a semicolon
# (";"), independent of platform. (As opposed to the Java convention,
# which is either ";" or ":" depending on platform.)
#
# All these property definitions get loaded into an E process'
# System.properties, so long as they don't override an already present
# property. This is so command-line property settings (using
# arguments of the form "-D<name>=<value>) will take precedence over
# property settings in eprops.txt.
#
# The eprops.txt file should serve as a record of everywhere (outside
# of the install directory itself) that installation placed files and
# registry entries, so that a future uninstaller will know (fingers
# crossed) what files and registry entries to remove.

# What version of E is this?
#
# For example, "0.8.9".

e.version=${{e.version}}

# What subdirectory name is used for files specific to this OS?
#
# One of "win32", "linux-motif", "linux-gtk", "mac", "freebsd",

# Where is E installed?  If this file is eprops.txt (as opposed to
# eprops-template.txt) then this eprops.txt file should be in this
# directory.
#
# For example, "c:/Program Files/erights.org/",
#              "/usr/local/e" (suitable for a *nix system install),
#              or "~/ehome" (for a personal install).

e.home=${{e.home}}


# What is the absolute path of the Java executable command?  This must
# be a Java compatible with Sun's JDK >= 1.3. On MSWindows, if you
# wish to suppress the MSDOS console window, use a javaw.exe command
# rather than a java.exe command.
#
# For example, "c:/jdk1.3/bin/java.exe",
#              or (if a suitable java is on the user's PATH) just "java".

e.javacmd=${{e.javacmd}}


# When E shortcuts are launched from the desktop, where should their
# current directory be?  Under *nix currently, this option does
# nothing. On MSWindows, this option affects only newly generated
# shortcuts. After changing this option, rerun the setup.e-awt
# command to generate new shortcuts.
#
# For example: "~/Desktop" or "".

e.launch.dir=${{e.launch.dir}}


# Where does trace data go?  This directory will accumulate
# debugging information provided by running E programs in order to
# facilitate a post-mortem analysis of problems. The trace system
# treats the directory as a large circular buffer giving a finite
# window into the past in exchange for a finite memory burden.
#
# For example: "c:/WINDOWS/temp/etrace" (suitable for Windows9*),
#              "~/Local Settings/Temp/etrace" (for Windows2K/XP),
#              or "~/.e/etrace".

# If this property is set, JDK1.3's EventDispatchThread's
# handleException(Throwable) will delegate exception reporting
# to a newly made instance of this class name.

# This should generally be set to "org.erights.e.ui.awt.AWTProblemHandler".

# Where are copies of the "rune" bash script placed?  Since E scripts
# (*.e and *.e-* files) normally begin with the line "#!/usr/bin/env
# rune", an E script won't be considered an executable file unless
# /usr/bin/env can find the bash script "rune" on the PATH. On
# MSWindows, this option is only relevant to Cygwin users. The "rune"
# bash script should be placed somewhere on the PATH visible from a
# shell. (On MSWindows, this means the Cygwin shell, not the MSDOS
# shell).
#
# For example: "c:/WINDOWS/;~/bin" or "/usr/local/bin".

################## Other Switches #####################


# One of "report", "prompt", or "gui" (the default). <p>
#
# When E fails to launch, or when the top level E script (the *.e or *.e-*
# file) throws a problem, how should the E interpreter report the problem
# before exiting with a non-zero error code?
#
# When this property is set to "report" (or when the property is
# absent), then E prints a problem report on stderr and exits
# immediately. <p>
#
# When set to "prompt", E still prints the problem report on stderr,
# but it then also prompts for a character to be typed in before the
# process is dismissed, and then blocks waiting for that
# character. <p>
#
# When set to "gui", E will pop up a window at least reporting the
# error and waiting to be dismissed. Later versions of E may provide
# support for diagnostics and debugging starting from this window.
# Note: "gui" is not yet implemented. If used, it will prompt
# instead.

e.onErrorExit=gui


# Was the program as a whole launched from the gui, in which case
# there's not necessarily a console -- a visible place where stdout
# and stderr go, nor is there necessarily a way to receive keystrokes
# via stdin. Further, if there is a console, it probably doesn't last
# beyond successful program termination.
#
# This defaults to false, but shortcuts for each window system should
# provide an argument of the form "-De.gui-launch=true".

e.gui-launch=false


# How should the process exit on success, when e.gui-launch is true?
# The fault is "ignore", meaning exit silently and immediately. But
# command-line-only programs, like updoc, may want to set it instead
# to "prompt". As with e.onErrorExit, this will prompt for a character
# to be typed in, and then blocks waiting for that character.

e.onOkGuiExit=ignore


# One of "platform" (the default), "none", or a look and feel class
# name. <p>
#
# When set to "platform" (or when the property is absent), the look
# and feel is set to the default for the platform according to
# "UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName()". <p>
#
# When set to "none", this advises code that there may not be an
# available graphical display device, and that they should try, if
# possible, to avoid any operations which would fail in a pure
# character/teletype environment, such as a telnet session. <p>
#
# When set to a look and feel class name, it sets this to be the
# initial look and feel for this E process.

e.swingLnF=platform


# Currently does nothing.
#
# A placeholder for the new safej API taming. For classes for which
# there are no corresponding taming files, this switch says how they
# should be made available to E. If "true", then these classes will
# be importable as "<unsafe:...>". If "false", then untamed classes
# will not be available at all. Defaults to "false".

e.safej.allow-untamed-classes=false


# When true, the E parser outputs volunimous debugging info. Defaults
# to false.

e.interp.parseSpam=false


# In an interactive interpreter, when this is set to true, the
# expansion to Kernel-E of the entered expression is echoed along with
# the value it evaluates to. Defaults to false.

e.interp.expand=false


# In an interactive interpreter, when this is set to true, the
# further expansion to an internal form is echoed. This is for
# debugging the transformation to an implementation-dependent optimized
# internal form (Transformed-E), and probably serves no function for normal
# use. The output is implementation dependent. Defaults to false.

e.interp.show-transformed=false


# Says whether E should print, as a diagnostic on stderr, the total
# post-initialization time to interpret the E program. Defaults to
# false.

e.interp.print-timing=false


################# Configuring a Vat's network presence #################


# e.VLSPath is an optional semicolon-separated list of TCP/IP
# addresses of VLSs this vat should register with. Defaults to "" --
# the null list. Doesn't actually mean anything until the VLS is
# revived.

# e.VLSPath=


# e.SearchPath is an optional semicolon-separated list of TCP/IP
# addresses for others to look for me. Defaults to the VLSPath. Once
# a vat knows its own ListenAddressPath, this should be added to the front
# of the search path.

# e.SearchPath=


# e.ListenAddressPath is the optional TCP/IP addresses at which this
# vat should create the sockets it listens to. For each element, if
# an IP address isn't given, the socket defaults to listening on all
# IP addresses of this host. If an IP address is given, it must be
# one of the IP addresses of this host. If the TCP port isn't given,
# it defaults to 0. A TCP port of 0 instructs the OS to pick any free
# TCP port.

# e.ListenAddressPath=



# Is a Java public instance or static variable named 'foo' bound to E
# methods foo/0 and (if not final) foo/1, for the getter and setter
# respectively? This binding is hereby deprecated, and we expect to
# set this property to false by default in a future release.
# This is a per-jvm scoped setting.

e.safej.bind-var-to-varName=false


# Is a Java public instance or static variable named 'foo' bound to E
# methods getFoo/0 and (if not final) setFoo/1, for the getter and setter
# respectively? This binding is new as of 0.8.20, but is expected to
# become the new standard way for E to operate.
# This is a per-jvm scoped setting.

e.safej.bind-var-to-propName=true


# When true, problem reports by default show the Java stack trace.
# (Once E is compiled, there will only be one stack trace
# to report, the Java stack trace, which will be reported if either
# this or e.interp.show-e-stack is set.)  Defaults to false.

e.interp.show-j-stack=false


# When true, problem reports by default show the E stack
# trace. Defaults to true.

e.interp.show-e-stack=true


################ New as of 0.8.24a #######################

# XXX kludge: This shouldn't be an eprops switch, but just a command-line
# option to updoc.e

updoc.verbose=false


################ Discontinued Switches ####################

# e.interp.interactive, since it shouldn't be determined by a property
# and no longer is.

# e.interp.verbose has been renamed e.interp.show-j-stack in order
# to have the Java-written repls correspond more closely to the
# E-written repls.

# e.ListenAddress is no longer supported. Use e.ListenAddressPath (as
# explained above) instead.

#### Discontinued as of 0.8.24d ####

# e.vendor.url.bug is now retired because the email address it named receives
# too much spam to be useful.

#### Discontinued as of 0.8.26b ####

# e.persist.useJOSS is now retired along with all support for JOSS-based
# persistence. E's persistence now relies on Data-E serialization.
