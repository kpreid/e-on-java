            <P>Here at the Microsoft Security Response Center, we investigate
            thousands of security reports every year. In some cases, we find
            that a report describes a bona fide security vulnerability resulting
            from a flaw in one of our products; when this happens, we develop a
            patch as quickly as possible to correct the error. (See "A Tour of
            the Microsoft Security Response Center"). In other cases, the
            reported problems simply result from a mistake someone made in using
            the product. But many fall in between. They discuss real security
            problems, but the problems don't result from product flaws. Over the
            years, we've developed a list of issues like these, that we call the
            Ten Immutable Laws of Security.
            <P>Don't hold your breath waiting for a patch that will protect you
            from the issues we'll discuss below. It isn't possible for Microsoft
            - or any software vendor - to "fix" them, because they result from
            the way computers work. But don't abandon all hope yet - sound
            judgment is the key to protecting yourself against these issues, and
            if you keep them in mind, you can significantly improve the security
            of your systems. <!--begin bookmark heading-->

            <P>It's an unfortunate fact of computer science: when a computer
            program runs, it will do what it's programmed to do, even if it's
            programmed to be harmful. When you choose to run a program, you are
            making a decision to turn over control of your computer to it. Once
            a program is running, it can do anything, up to the limits of what
            you yourself can do on the machine. It could monitor your keystrokes
            and send them to a web site. It could open every document on the
            machine, and change the word "will" to "won't" in all of them. It
            could send rude emails to all your friends. It could install a
            virus. It could create a "back door" that lets someone remotely
            control your machine. It could dial up an ISP in Katmandu. Or it
            could just reformat your hard drive.
            <P>That's why it's important to never run, or even download, a
            program from an untrusted source - and by "source", I mean the
            person who wrote it, not the person who gave it to you. There's a
            nice analogy between running a program and eating a sandwich. If a
            stranger walked up to you and handed you a sandwich, would you eat
            it? Probably not. How about if your best friend gave you a sandwich?
            Maybe you would, maybe you wouldn't - it depends on whether she made
            it or found it lying in the street. Apply the same critical thought
            to a program that you would to a sandwich, and you'll usually be
            safe. <!--begin bookmark heading-->

            <P>In the end, an operating system is just a series of ones and
            zeroes that, when interpreted by the processor, cause the machine to
            do certain things. Change the ones and zeroes, and it will do
            something different. Where are the ones and zeroes stored? Why, on
            the machine, right along with everything else! They're just files,
            and if other people who use the machine are permitted to change
            those files, it's "game over".
            <P>To understand why, consider that operating system files are among
            the most trusted ones on the computer, and they generally run with
            system-level privileges. That is, they can do absolutely anything.
            Among other things, they're trusted to manage user accounts, handle
            password changes, and enforce the rules governing who can do what on
            the computer. If a bad guy can change them, the now-untrustworthy
            files will do his bidding, and there's no limit to what he can do.
            He can steal passwords, make himself an administrator on the
            machine, or add entirely new functions to the operating system. To
            prevent this type of attack, make sure that the system files (and
            the registry, for that matter) are well protected. (The <A

            <P>Oh, the things a bad guy can do if he can lay his hands on your
            computer! Here's a sampling, going from Stone Age to Space Age:
            <UL>
              <LI><FONT class=ListPara1>He could mount the ultimate low-tech
              denial of service attack, and smash your computer with a
              sledgehammer.</FONT>
              <LI><FONT class=ListPara1>He could unplug the computer, haul it
              out of your building, and hold it for ransom. </FONT>
              <LI><FONT class=ListPara1>He could boot the computer from a floppy
              disk, and reformat your hard drive. But wait, you say, I've
              configured the BIOS on my computer to prompt for a password when I
              turn the power on. No problem - if he can open the case and get
              his hands on the system hardware, he could just replace the BIOS
              chips. (Actually, there are even easier ways). </FONT>
              <LI><FONT class=ListPara1>He could remove the hard drive from your
              computer, install it into his computer, and read it.</FONT>
              <LI><FONT class=ListPara1>He could make a duplicate of your hard
              drive and take it back his lair. Once there, he'd have all the
              time in the world to conduct brute-force attacks, such as trying
              every possible logon password. Programs are available to automate
              this and, given enough time, it's almost certain that he would
              succeed. Once that happens, Laws #1 and #2 above apply</FONT>
              <LI><FONT class=ListPara1>He could replace your keyboard with one
              that contains a radio transmitter. He could then monitor
              everything you type, including your password.</FONT> </LI></UL>
            <P>Always make sure that a computer is physically protected in a way
            that's consistent with its value - and remember that the value of a
            machine includes not only the value of the hardware itself, but the
            value of the data on it, <B>and</B> the value of the access to your
            network that a bad guy could gain. At a minimum, business-critical
            machines like domain controllers, database servers, and print/file
            servers should always be in a locked room that only people charged
            with administration and maintenance can access. But you may want to
            consider protecting other machines as well, and potentially using
            additional protective measures.
            <P>If you travel with a laptop, it's absolutely critical that you
            protect it. The same features that make laptops great to travel with
            - small size, light weight, and so forth - also make them easy to
            steal. There are a variety of locks and alarms available for
            laptops, and some models let you remove the hard drive and carry it
            with you. You also can use features like the Encrypting File System
            in Windows 2000 to mitigate the damage if someone succeeded in
            stealing the computer. But the only way you can know with 100%
            certainty that your data is safe and the hardware hasn't been
            tampered with is to keep the laptop on your person at all times
            while traveling. <!--begin bookmark heading-->

            <P>This is basically Law #1 in reverse. In that scenario, the bad
            guy tricks his victim into downloading a harmful program onto his
            machine and running it. In this one, the bad guy uploads a harmful
            program to a machine and runs it himself. Although this scenario is
            a danger anytime you allow strangers to connect to your machine, web
            sites are involved in the overwhelming majority of these cases. Many
            people who operate web sites are too hospitable for their own good,
            and allow visitors to upload programs to the site and run them. As
            we've seen above, unpleasant things can happen if a bad guy's
            program can run on your machine.
            <P>If you run a web site, you need to limit what visitors can do.
            You should only allow a program on your site if you wrote it
            yourself, or if you trust the developer who wrote it. But that may
            not be enough. If your web site is one of several hosted on a shared
            server, you need to be extra careful. If a bad guy can compromise
            one of the other sites on the server, it's possible he could extend
            his control to the server itself, in which he could control all of
            the sites on it - including yours. If you're on a shared server,
            it's important to find out what the server administrator's policies
            are. (By the way, before opening your site to the public, make sure
            you've followed the <A

            <P>The purpose of having a logon process is to establish who you
            are. Once the operating system knows who you are, it can grant or
            deny requests for system resources appropriately. If a bad guy
            learns your password, he can log on as you. In fact, as far as the
            operating system is concerned, he <B>is</B> you. Whatever you can do
            on the system, he can do as well, because he's you. Maybe he wants
            to read sensitive information you've stored on your computer, like
            your email. Maybe you have more privileges on the network than he
            does, and being you will let him do things he normally couldn't. Or
            maybe he just wants to do something malicious and blame it on you.
            In any case, it's worth protecting your credentials.
            <P>Always use a password - it's amazing how many accounts have blank
            passwords. And choose a complex one. Don't use your dog's name, your
            anniversary date, or the name of the local football team. And don't
            use the word "password"! Pick a password that has a mix of upper-
            and lower-case letters, number, punctuation marks, and so forth.
            Make it as long as possible. And change it often. Once you've picked
            a strong password, handle it appropriately. Don't write it down. If
            you absolutely must write it down, at the very least keep it in a
            safe or a locked drawer - the first thing a bad guy who's hunting
            for passwords will do is check for a yellow sticky note on the side
            of your screen, or in the top desk drawer. Don't tell anyone what
            your password is. Remember what Ben Franklin said: two people can
            keep a secret, but only if one of them is dead.
            <P>Finally, consider using something stronger than passwords to
            identify yourself to the system. Windows 2000, for instance,
            supports the use of smart cards, which significantly strengthens the
            identity checking the system can perform. You may also want to
            consider biometric products like fingerprint and retina scanners. <!--begin bookmark heading-->

            <P>Every computer must have an administrator: someone who can
            install software, configure the operating system, add and manage
            user accounts, establish security policies, and handle all the other
            management tasks associated with keeping a computer up and running.
            By definition, these tasks require that he have control over the
            machine. This puts the administrator in a position of unequalled
            power. An untrustworthy administrator can negate every other
            security measure you've taken. He can change the permissions on the
            machine, modify the system security policies, install malicious
            software, add bogus users, or do any of a million other things. He
            can subvert virtually any protective measure in the operating
            system, because he controls it. Worst of all, he can cover his
            tracks. If you have an untrustworthy administrator, you have
            absolutely no security.
            <P>When hiring a system administrator, recognize the position of
            trust that administrators occupy, and only hire people who warrant
            that trust. Call his references, and ask them about his previous
            work record, especially with regard to any security incidents at
            previous employers. If appropriate for your organization, you may
            also consider taking a step that banks and other security-conscious
            companies do, and require that your administrators pass a complete
            background check at hiring time, and at periodic intervals
            afterward. Whatever criteria you select, apply them across the
            board. Don't give anyone administrative privileges on your network
            unless they've been vetted - and this includes temporary employees
            and contractors, too.
            <P>Next, take steps to help keep honest people honest. Use
            sign-in/sign-out sheets to track who's been in the server room. (You
            do have a server room with a locked door, right? If not, re-read Law
            #3). Implement a "two person" rule when installing or upgrading
            software. Diversify management tasks as much as possible, as a way
            of minimizing how much power any one administrator has. Also, don't
            use the Administrator account - instead, give each administrator a
            separate account with administrative privileges, so you can tell
            who's doing what. Finally, consider taking steps to make it more
            difficult for a rogue administrator to cover his tracks. For
            instance, store audit data on write-only media, or house System A's
            audit data on System B, and make sure that the two systems have
            different administrators. The more accountable your administrators
            are, the less likely you are to have problems. <!--begin bookmark heading-->

            <P>Suppose you installed the biggest, strongest, most secure lock in
            the world on your front door, but you put the key under the front
            door mat. It wouldn't really matter how strong the lock is, would
            it? The critical factor would be the poor way the key was protected,
            because if a burglar could find it, he'd have everything he needed
            to open the lock. Encrypted data works the same way - no matter how
            strong the cryptoalgorithm is, the data is only as safe as the key
            that can decrypt it.
            <P>Many operating systems and cryptographic software products give
            you an option to store cryptographic keys on the computer. The
            advantage is convenience - you don't have to handle the key - but it
            comes at the cost of security. The keys are usually obfuscated (that
            is, hidden), and some of the obfuscation methods are quite good. But
            in the end, no matter how well-hidden the key is, if it's on the
            machine it can be found. It has to be - after all, the software can
            find it, so a sufficiently-motivated bad guy could find it, too.
            Whenever possible, use offline storage for keys. If the key is a
            word or phrase, memorize it. If not, export it to a floppy disk,
            make a backup copy, and store the copies in separate, secure
            locations. (All of you administrators out there who are using <A
            href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q143/4/75.asp">Syskey</A>
            in "local storage" mode - you're going to reconfigure your server

            <P>Virus scanners work by comparing the data on your computer
            against a collection of virus "signatures". Each signature is
            characteristic of a particular virus, and when the scanner finds
            data in a file, email, or elsewhere that matches the signature, it
            concludes that it's found a virus. However, a virus scanner can only
            scan for the viruses it knows about. It's vital that you keep your
            virus scanner's signature file up to date, as new viruses are
            created every day.
            <P>The problem actually goes a bit deeper than this, though.
            Typically, a new virus will do the greatest amount of damage during
            the early stages of its life, precisely because few people will be
            able to detect it. Once word gets around that a new virus is on the
            loose and people update their virus signatures, the spread of the
            virus falls off drastically. The key is to get ahead of the curve,
            and have updated signature files on your machine before the virus
            hits.
            <P>Virtually every maker of anti-virus software provides a way to
            get free updated signature files from their web site. In fact, many
            have "push" services, in which they'll send notification every time
            a new signature file is released. Use these services. Also, keep the
            virus scanner itself - that is, the scanning software - updated as
            well. Virus writers periodically develop new techniques that require
            that the scanners change how they do their work. <!--begin bookmark heading-->

            <P>All human interaction involves exchanging data of some kind. If
            someone weaves enough of that data together, they can identify you.
            Think about all the information that a person can glean in just a
            short conversation with you. In one glance, they can gauge your
            height, weight, and approximate age. Your accent will probably tell
            them what country you're from, and may even tell them what region of
            the country. If you talk about anything other than the weather,
            you'll probably tell them something about your family, your
            interests, where you live, and what you do for a living. It doesn't
            take long for someone to collect enough information to figure out
            who you are. If you crave absolute anonymity, your best bet is to
            live in a cave and shun all human contact.
            <P>The same thing is true of the Internet. If you visit a web site,
            the owner can, if he's sufficiently motivated, find out who you are.
            After all, the ones and zeroes that make up the web session have be
            able to find their way to the right place, and that place is your
            computer. There are a lot of measures you can take to disguise the
            bits, and the more of them you use, the more thoroughly the bits
            will be disguised. For instance, you could use network address
            translation to mask your actual IP address, subscribe to an
            anonymizing service that launders the bits by relaying them from one
            end of the ether to the other, use a different ISP account for
            different purposes, surf certain sites only from public kiosks, and
            so on. All of these make it more difficult to determine who you are,
            but none of them make it impossible. Do you know for certain who
            operates the anonymizing service? Maybe it's the same person who
            owns the web site you just visited! Or what about that innocuous web
            site you visited yesterday, that offered to mail you a free $10 off
            coupon? Maybe the owner is willing to share information with other
            web site owners. If so, the second web site owner may be able to
            correlate the information from the two sites and determine who you
            are.
            <P>Does this mean that privacy on the web is a lost cause? Not at
            all. What it means is that the best way to protect your privacy on
            the Internet is the same as the way you protect your privacy in
            normal life - through your behavior. Read the privacy statements on
            the web sites you visit, and only do business with ones whose
            practices you agree with. If you're worried about cookies, disable
            them. Most importantly, avoid indiscriminate web surfing - recognize
            that just as most cities have a bad side of town that's best
            avoided, the Internet does too. But if it's complete and total
            anonymity you want, better start looking for that cave. <!--begin bookmark heading-->

            <P>Technology can do some amazing things. Recent years have seen the
            development of ever-cheaper and more powerful hardware, software
            that harnesses the hardware to open new vistas for computer users,
            as well as advancements in cryptography and other sciences. It's
            tempting to believe that technology can deliver a risk-free world,
            if we just work hard enough. However, this is simply not realistic.
            <P>Perfect security requires a level of perfection that simply
            doesn't exist, and in fact isn't likely to ever exist. This is true
            for software as well as virtually all fields of human interest.
            Software development is an imperfect science, and all software has
            bugs. Some of them can be exploited to cause security breaches.
            That's just a fact of life. But even if software could be made
            perfect, it wouldn't solve the problem entirely. Most attacks
            involve, to one degree or another, some manipulation of human nature
            - this is usually referred to as social engineering. Raise the cost
            and difficulty of attacking security technology, and bad guys will
            respond by shifting their focus away from the technology and toward
            the human being at the console. It's vital that you understand your
            role in maintaining solid security, or you could become the chink in
            your own systems' armor.
            <P>The solution is to recognize two essential points. First,
            security consists of both technology and policy - that is, it's the
            combination of the technology and how it's used that ultimately
            determines how secure your systems are. Second, security is journey,
            not a destination - it isn't a problem that can be "solved" once and
            for all; it's a constant series of moves and countermoves between
            the good guys and the bad guys. The key is to ensure that you have
            good security awareness and exercise sound judgment. There are
            resources available to help you do this. The Microsoft Security web
            site, for instance, has hundreds of white papers, best practices
            guides, checklists and tools, and we're developing more all the
            time. Combine great technology with sound judgment, and you'll have
            rock-solid security.
