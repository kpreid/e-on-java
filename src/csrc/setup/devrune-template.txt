# Development-time E Driver Script (or E Driver Script Template)
# based on rune-template.txt
#
# If you are looking at "devrune-template.txt", then you are looking at a
# template to be used to construct "devrune".
# In this case, for some variable definitions, you should instead see
# text of the form, for example,
#
#     EDEV="$<<e.dev.home>>"
#
# but with curly brackets instead of angle brackets.
#
# In the comment preceding this, you should see an example of a
# possible value of this property, such as
# "c:/e/". Were this variable to have this value in the "devrune"
# file, it would appear as
#
#     EDEV="c:/e/"
#
# All these variables except EDEV come from eprops.txt. See that
# file (or eprops-template.txt) for more complete documentation.
